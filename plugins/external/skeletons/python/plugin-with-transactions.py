"""A skeleton for a Python rsyslog output plugin with error handling
and transaction support. Requires Python 3.

To integrate a plugin based on this skeleton with rsyslog, configure an
'omprog' action like the following:
    action(type="omprog"
        binary="/usr/bin/myplugin.py"
        confirmMessages="on"
        useTransactions="on"
        ...)

    """An error that has caused the processing of the current transaction
    to fail, but does not require restarting the plugin.

    An example of such an error would be a temporary loss of connection to
    a database or a server. If such an error occurs in the onBeginTransation,
    onMessage or onCommitTransaction functions, your plugin should wrap it
    in a RecoverableError before raising it. For example:

-------------------------------------------------------
This is plumbing that DOES NOT need to be CHANGED
-------------------------------------------------------
This is the main loop that receives messages from rsyslog via stdin,
invokes the above entrypoints, and provides status codes to rsyslog
via stdout. In most cases, modifying this code should not be necessary.

You will have to change the code below if you need the following
advanced features:
    * Custom begin/end transaction marks: if you have configured the
    'omprog' action in rsyslog to use your own marks for transaction
    boundaries (instead of the default "BEGIN TRANSACTION" and "COMMIT
    TRANSACTION" messages), modify the code below accordingly.
    * Partial transaction commits: this skeleton confirms all messages
    inside a transaction using the "DEFER_COMMIT" status code. If you
    want to return the "PREVIOUS_COMMITED" or "OK" status codes within
    transactions, you will need to modify the code below. See
    http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/development/dev_oplugins.html
    for information about these status codes. Note that rsyslog will not
    send the "COMMIT TRANSACTION" mark if the last message in the
    transaction is confirmed with an "OK" status code.
